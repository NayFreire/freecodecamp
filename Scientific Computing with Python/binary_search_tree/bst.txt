In this project, you are going to create a Binary Search Tree (BST). A BST is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, with the left child containing values less than the parent node and the right child containing values greater than the parent node, allowing for efficient searching and sorting operations.

An example is the image "bst-example.png"
